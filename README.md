# ai-roadmap-poc

### Overview

**ai-roadmap-poc** is a proof-of-concept for an AI-driven career roadmap system.
The project explores how a single large language model (LLM) can be orchestrated as a structured service to:

- Analyze a user’s CV (PDF)
- Recommend suitable job roles
- Estimate an appropriate learning timeline
- Identify skill gaps
- Generate a structured, UI-ready career roadmap
- Provide a guarded, domain-specific chat assistant

This repository is intended for **experimentation and architectural validation**, not production use.

> documentation present in `./docs` folder should be used as a reference for the project.
